A SPA web app named "to-do-haha"
----
To-do list webapp is really a widely used practice subject. I decide to make such a app to make a first impression of MVC(Backbone, Angular etc.). Some other technology may be used:

- [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)
- AppCache & LocalStorage
- [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org/)
- [Glup](http://gulpjs.com/)
- [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)
